                While <strong>Tree Cut &amp; Trim</strong> may be well known for our ability to clear land with our
                large machinery and
                plant, many are not aware tha alot of our operation involves land restoration and vegetation
                protection. We love restoring land back to its former natural glory and often engage
                in projects that take many years to come into fruition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Land clearing is just one part of <strong>Tree Cut &amp; Trim's</strong> wider service area. We have
                teams in New Zealand
                who provide expertise and knowledge to clients and the wider community on wildlife protection, bio
                security, and effective long term vegetation management and planting projects. We work within the
                constraints of the environment to ensure the best result is obtained, working with natureâ€™s
                restrictions such as water shortages an tight spaces, moving mountains to make plans a reality.
                We are hugely aware of the risks of biosecurity, and of our longer term commitment to leaving
                our environment in better health than it was when we discovered it.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Tree Cut &amp; Trim</strong> work closely with our communities, assisting with planting projects
                and donating mulch to schools
                and other community organisations. We are committed to ensuring that the spaces we work within are
                greatly
                improved as a result of having <strong>Tree Cut &amp; Trim</strong> there, and welcome stories on your
                restoration projects, or
                requests for community assistance.</p>
